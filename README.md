I’m a software developer with a bachelor’s degree in information technology engineering.
I am a Backend Developer! and my favorite language is Golang since 2020 . I have experience with Frontend development too. I can summarize my life with the following code:

```golang
go inLove([]string{"Go Programming language","JavaScript"})
go research([]string{"Network Services", "Cloud"})
for aLive() == true {
  eat()
  code()
  gym()
  sleep()
}
```
