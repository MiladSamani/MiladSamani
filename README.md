I’m a software developer with a bachelor’s degree in information technology engineering. From the age of fifteen, I became interested in the world of the web and began to create persian blog templates & I also have experience in the web development! I am a Full Stack Developer! I can summarize my life with the following code:
```golang
go inLove([]string{"Golang" , "JavaScript"})
for aLive() == true {
  eat()
  code()
  gym()
  sleep()
}
```
