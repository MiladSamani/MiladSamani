 Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on GoDev(Golang learning platform)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Golang issues!

Iâ€™m a software developer with a bachelorâ€™s degree in information technology engineering from Shiraz University.
From the age of fifteen, I became interested in the world of the web and began to create persian blog templates. After entering the university, I entered web programming professionally and worked on more than 30 projects so far.
I started programming with PHP server side language and now I am working with Golang.
