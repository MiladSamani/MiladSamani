Hi

I’m a software developer with a bachelor’s degree in information technology engineering from Shiraz University.
From the age of fifteen, I became interested in the world of the web and began to create persian blog templates. After entering the university, I entered web programming professionally and worked on more than 30 projects so far.
I started programming with PHP and JavaScript , now I am working with Golang Programming language.
